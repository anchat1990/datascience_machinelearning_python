# datascience_machinelearning_python
Everything I learnt in the datascience and machine learning course in udemy
Jupyter docs -->      http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html

- open canopy command line
- enter "jupyter notebook"
- navigate to the notebook file "<something>.ipynb"
- press run 

Notes:

mean is average,
median is mid point of frequency distribution
mode is most appearing value
variance is average of squared diff to mean
std dev is sqr rt of variance
sample variance is divided by (N-1) where N is the number of samples
probability density is the probability that a data point falls in some given range (continuous)
probability mass function (discrete dataset) basically a histogram
uniform distr is flat - equal probability     
90th percentile - 90% of the data is less than that. so 50th percentile is the median.
